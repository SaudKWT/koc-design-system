         * min-width and height are equal so it renders as a true circle, and at
         * three digits it grows into a pill instead of clipping the number or
         * squashing it into an ellipse. A hard-coded circle looks right until
         * the first count reaches 100, which on an operations dashboard is a
         * matter of time.
         *
         * The padding is `px-1`, not `px-1.5`: at 1.5 a single digit plus 12px
         * of padding measured 21px against a 20px height — one pixel out of
         * round, which is invisible in a spec and obvious on a 20px circle.
         * At `px-1` the min-width wins for one and two digits and the padding
         * only takes over at three.
         *
         * `tabular-nums` so a count ticking 8 → 9 → 10 does not jitter.
