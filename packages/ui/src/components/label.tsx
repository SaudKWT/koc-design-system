 * A native <label>. The Radix primitive this wrapped added only one behaviour
 * — suppressing text selection on double click — which `select-none` covers
 * without a dependency. (This file was the audit's blind spot: it imported
 * `@radix-ui/react-label` directly rather than the `radix-ui` umbrella the
 * exposure grep counted, so it never appeared in the 14.)
