/**
 * AppShell — the standard KOC team dashboard frame.
 *
 * One dashboard is one **team**. The unit is a context you switch, not a nav
 * section you scroll past: seven units × five apps is thirty-five permanent
 * items, thirty-four of which are irrelevant to any given user. See lib/org.ts
 * for the full reasoning.
 *
 * The shell holds three zones, and which zone an app lands in is decided by its
 * scope rather than by whoever adds it:
 *
 *   1. Unit switcher (header)  — which unit's work you are looking at
 *   2. Unit nav (content)      — that unit's workflows and apps
 *   3. Team-wide (content)     — invoicing, GIS, shared reporting. Never filtered.
 *
 * Building a dashboard for another KOC team means writing a TeamConfig. No JSX,
 * no new component, no fork. That is the whole point — there are on the order of
 * a few hundred teams, and a hand-built sidebar each is how a standard dies.

 * The account menu, in the sidebar footer.

 * simply wrong: SIDEBAR_WIDTH_ICON is 3rem — 48px — and SidebarFooter carries no
 * collapse rule, so it stays visible. An `lg` SidebarMenuButton collapses to
 * exactly 32px inside that 48px rail through the sidebar's own size overrides,
 * with no extra CSS. The constraint that moved it away never existed.
 *
 * It also replaces a real defect. The footer previously rendered a
 * SidebarMenuButton — a genuine <button> — with no handler: focusable, in the
 * tab order, doing nothing. Anyone who tabbed to it got silence.
 *
 * TWO TRAPS, both of which fail silently:
 *
 *   1. NO `tooltip` PROP. With one, SidebarMenuButton returns a Tooltip root
 *      rather than a button, and DropdownMenuTrigger asChild would clone a
 *      non-DOM Radix component — the menu never opens, and nothing errors.
 *   2. NOT the UserMenu component. It renders a Button, which has neither
 *      overflow-hidden nor any of the sidebar's icon-rail size overrides, so it
 *      overflows the collapsed rail. The markup here is the sidebar's own.
 *
 * `side="right"` on the content is what makes it usable from the collapsed rail:
 * a menu opening upward from a 48px column would be clipped by the viewport edge.

               * A hand-rolled `<span className="ml-auto">` inside the button
               * breaks two things at once. The sidebar styles the label with
               * `[&>span:last-child]:truncate` — an inline badge becomes the last
               * span, so the badge gets truncated and the label loses its
               * truncation, wraps, and spills out of the collapsed 32px rail.
               * And a plain span has no collapse rule, so it stays visible in the
               * icon rail with nothing to attach to.
               *
               * SidebarMenuBadge is absolutely positioned and carries
               * `group-data-[collapsible=icon]:hidden`, so it disappears with the
               * label and never enters the button's flex row at all.
