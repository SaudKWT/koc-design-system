/**
 * Card — the primary surface for grouping dashboard content.
 *
 * Uses `border-border` (decorative, quiet) rather than `border-input`. A card's
 * edge is a grouping cue, not a control affordance, so it is deliberately low
 * contrast — a 3:1 outline around every panel would turn a dense dashboard into
 * a grid of boxes.
 *
 * RESTYLED 2026-08-12 to the shadcn canonical shape, which is also what
 * shadcn-space's dashboard-shell-03 renders. Padding moved from each slot onto
 * the Card as `py-6` plus per-slot `px-6`, with a `gap-6` between slots. That is
 * what lets a card carry a header, a divider and a footer without every slot
 * re-declaring its own padding and fighting the one above it.
 *
 * IT MAKES CARDS TALLER. A header sitting directly on content gains 24px of gap.
 * That is the intended change and it is visible in any consuming app the moment
 * @koc/card is re-added — nothing errors, cards simply grow.
 *
 * WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY NOT COPIED FROM THE REFERENCE:
 *
 *   Its 14px description. That means moving --text-sm from 0.8125rem, which
 *   re-points a class used on every table cell and form label in every consuming
 *   app — the exact re-flow docs/consumer-reports/2026-08-12-dwos.md measured.
 *   Not worth one pixel on a card description.
 *
 *   Its borderless hairline (a ~10% ring, no border). Reproducing it means
 *   lightening --border to roughly neutral[100], which FAILS test:tokens against
 *   the 1.25:1 decorative floor, and collapses --border onto accent/secondary/
 *   muted — the same token collapse that broke the DWOS toggle in v0.1.4.
 *
 *   Its KPI tiles, which wash a whole card in 10%-alpha hue that does not track
 *   sentiment: -12% on green, +23% on red. That is decoratively the failure
 *   stat-card.tsx exists to prevent, and its bg-teal-400/10 is a raw palette
 *   colour, which is invariant 1 outright.
