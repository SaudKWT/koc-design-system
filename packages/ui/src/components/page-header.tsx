/**
 * PageHeader — the top of every KOC application screen.
 *
 * Not in the shadcn registry and not in any block worth copying: every dashboard
 * kit improvises one, which is exactly why forty KOC apps would improvise forty
 * slightly different ones. This fixes the arrangement so a user moving between
 * two KOC apps finds the title, the context and the actions in the same places.
 *
 * WHY THE TITLE IS AN <h1>
 * ------------------------
 * The app shell contributes no heading — a sidebar is navigation, not document
 * structure. If the page does not supply an h1 the screen has no top-level
 * heading at all, and screen-reader users lose the single most-used way to
 * orient on a page. Making it structural here means a team cannot ship a screen
 * without one by forgetting.
 *
 * WHY BREADCRUMBS ARE OPTIONAL AND SHALLOW
 * ----------------------------------------
 * KOC nests four levels deep, and the temptation is to render the whole chain.
 * But Directorate and Group are identity rather than navigation — a user does
 * not travel up to them from a screen — and the unit is already in the sidebar
 * switcher. So a breadcrumb here should carry only the path *within* the app:
 * the list you came from, and where you are now. Anything more repeats the
 * chrome and buries the one link that matters.
