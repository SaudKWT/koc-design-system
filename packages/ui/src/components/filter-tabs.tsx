/**
 * FilterTabs — a segmented control that filters a view, with counts.
 *
 * The composition it replaces was eight lines of Tabs + TabsTrigger + Badge,
 * written by hand. That is not much code, and reuse is the weaker half of the
 * argument for having it.
 *
 * THE REAL REASON IT IS A COMPONENT
 * ---------------------------------
 * A `Tabs` with no `TabsContent` is an accessibility defect that looks like
 * working code. Radix wires `aria-controls` from every trigger to its panel; with
 * no panel the attribute points at an id that does not exist, so a screen reader
 * announces a tab controlling nothing. axe rates it critical, and it was the
 * first thing the a11y harness found when it was written — in this repo, in a
 * component someone had already reviewed.
 *
 * It is an easy mistake precisely because the visible result is correct. The
 * tabs look right, they switch, and nothing in the browser complains. So the
 * component takes `renderPanel` rather than children: there is no way to
 * construct a FilterTabs whose triggers point at nothing, in the same way
 * `ConfirmDialog` takes a required `subject` so nobody ships "Delete Item?".
 *
 * WHY COUNTS ARE PART OF IT
 * -------------------------
 * A filter without volume makes you click each option to find out where the work
 * is, and an empty option is indistinguishable from a full one until you land on
 * it. Showing the count means an empty filter is visibly empty rather than a
 * disappointment. `0` renders as `0` — never hidden, since the absence of a
 * badge would read as "unknown" rather than "none".
