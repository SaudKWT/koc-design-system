/**
 * ConfirmDialog — a decision that cannot be undone.
 *
 * Adapted from shadcn-space's dialog-02: centred icon, plain question, two
 * equal-weight buttons. Two things changed in the port.
 *
 * FIRST, IT TAKES THE SUBJECT AS A PROP.
 * The original hardcodes "Delete Item". A confirmation that does not name what
 * it is about to destroy is the mechanism by which people delete the wrong
 * thing — you click through three identical dialogs and the fourth one was a
 * different record. `subject` is required for exactly that reason, so the
 * question reads "Delete report BG-1042?" and the user can catch the mistake.
 *
 * SECOND, THE CONFIRM BUTTON IS NOT AUTOFOCUSED.
 * Radix focuses the first focusable element on open. For a destructive dialog
 * that must be Cancel, not Delete — otherwise a stray Enter, which is a very
 * common way to dismiss a dialog, destroys the record. The cancel button is
 * ordered first and carries the initial focus.
