/**
 * ConfirmDialog — a decision that cannot be undone.
 *
 * Adapted from shadcn-space's dialog-02: centred icon, plain question, two
 * equal-weight buttons. Two things changed in the port.
 *
 * FIRST, IT TAKES THE SUBJECT AS A PROP.
 * The original hardcodes "Delete Item". A confirmation that does not name what
 * it is about to destroy is the mechanism by which people delete the wrong
 * thing — you click through three identical dialogs and the fourth one was a
 * different record. `subject` is required for exactly that reason, so the
 * question reads "Delete report BG-1042?" and the user can catch the mistake.
 *
 * SECOND, THE CONFIRM BUTTON NEVER TAKES INITIAL FOCUS.
 * On a destructive dialog focus must open on Cancel, not Delete — otherwise a
 * stray Enter, which is a very common way to dismiss a dialog, destroys the
 * record. Under Radix that was achieved by ordering alone (it focused the
 * first focusable child). Base UI's default is the same — first tabbable
 * element, or the popup itself when opened by touch, which is equally safe —
 * but here the intent is structural: `initialFocus` points at the cancel
 * button explicitly, so reordering the footer can never move focus onto the
 * destructive action.
