 * Input.

 * `border-input` is the token that carries KOC's WCAG 1.4.11 compliance —
 * measured 3.63:1 against the page and 3.96:1 on a card. Do not "soften" this to
 * `border-border` to make forms look lighter: that border is the only thing
 * telling a user the field exists, and dropping it to 1.6:1 makes the form
 * invisible to low-vision users while looking fine to everyone reviewing it.
