/**
 * StatusBadge — operational state for wells, assets, jobs and runs.
 *
 * This is the most safety-relevant component in the system, and its API is shaped
 * to make the unsafe version unbuildable rather than merely discouraged.
 *
 * WCAG 1.4.1 ("Use of Color") requires that colour is never the *only* carrier of
 * meaning. The usual way that rule is broken is not malice — it is a `<Badge
 * variant="destructive">` with a colour and nothing else, shipped by someone in a
 * hurry. So this component does not accept a colour. It accepts a `status`, and
 * derives colour, icon and label together. There is no prop that lets a caller
 * keep the red and drop the icon.
 *
 * Why it matters here specifically: roughly 1 in 12 men has a colour-vision
 * deficiency, and KOC's operational readership skews heavily male. A red/green
 * status pair distinguished by hue alone is unreadable for a meaningful share of
 * the people this dashboard is for. The icon is not decoration — for those
 * readers it is the entire signal.
